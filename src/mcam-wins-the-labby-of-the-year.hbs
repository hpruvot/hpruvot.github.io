        <p class="mcam-body-text">
          For over 20 years, Mitsubishi Chemical Advanced Materialshas supplied advanced thermoplastic materials to
          replace
          aluminum and other metals for use in turbo-compressor labyrinth seals. One of the advantages ofpolymer seals
          is that
          metal tooth deformation and mating shaft damage during shaft rubsis eliminated. Thisresults in in extreme
          improvement in
          overall compressor efficiency over the life of the seals, because initial clearances can be tightened and
          the loss of
          clearance over time is reduced.Another advantage of polymer sealsis that mean time between repair (MTBR) is
          drastically
          reduced, because the seals maintain their high performance even after many years in service.<br>
          <br>Mitsubishi Chemicals
          Advanced Materials provided labyrinth seals to a leading OEM and testedtwo seal setsafter they were pulled
          out of
          service after 11 and 15 years. The tests resulted in mechanical property data that shows the performance of
          the Duratron
          T4540 PAIseals (made with Torlon resin) after 11 years and 15 years in service comparedto new“off-the-shelf”
          Duratron
          T4540PAI.During their time in service, thefirst seal set was exposed to temperatures between 47 and 60 °C,
          the second to
          temperatures between 31 and 45 °C.<br>
          <br>Visually, the seals were fine, with the exception of damage obtained during the
          removal process. They eachexhibited some form of damage ranging from a few gouges to being completely
          brokenapart.

        <p class="mcam-body-text">
          To evaluate the integrity of the Duratron T4540 PAI seals, a fewtypical mechanical properties of the
          returned seals were
          compared to those of standard in-stock Duratron T4540 PAI. Only one seal, the (initial set B-case,
          2ndwheel), was large
          enough to allow full-sized tensile test bars to be machined, providing tensile properties including
          strength, modulus,
          and elongation values. Other mechanical properties were also evaluated, including compressive strength and
          modulus but
          due to the limited sample size of the other smaller cross-section seals, only compressive test samples
          could be machined
          and tested.<br>
          <br>
          For the single seal in the 15-year second set, a full complement of testing was conducted except for the
          Tensile Modulus value that wasn’t obtained because the material couldn’t yield a full-size tensile
          bar.<br>
          <br>
          The property values from the in-service Duratron T4540 PAI were then compared to a baseline set of data.
          The T4540 baseline values
          were obtained from recent compression molded tubular bars representing the same production process as the
          returned
          “older” samples. Two tubes were pulled from production and test plaques were machined, tested, and results
          documented
          (18” OD x 11” ID x 6” L and 12” OD x 3.5” ID x 6” L).<br>
          <br>
          Table 2 below details the results of the mechanical property
          testing for both, the 11 year and 15 year in-service, polymer labyrinth seals.

            <p><strong>(2) B-Case</strong>, 2nd wheel was the only component large enough to allow for a
              full-sized machined Tensile Bar, which allowed
              for tensile strength, elongation, and modulus data. As a result, only compressive data was generated
              on the other
              samples.</p>

          Overall, the property values ofboth the 11-year and 15-year old Duratron T4540 PAI compressor seals
          compared quite nicely
          to typical data for this product.<br>
          <br>
          For the 11-year old seals, the tensile strengthand elongation properties of the B-Case
          sample were a little lower than baseline, but the tensile modulus was higher. This can be attributed to
          slight embrittlement of the product in service.
          The flexural and compressive propertieswere higher than current production which can also be attributed
          to the same reason.
          The Tg or glass-transition temperature of the 11-year old material remained steady at 280 oC which shows
          no major degradation
          of the polymeric structure.Also for these seals, the compressive strength and modulus values were
          tightly packed and within a 7% spreadshowing
          good data integrity amongst the returned seals.<br>
          <br>
          For the 15-year old seal, both tensile and compressive data compared very well to baseline
          valuesincluding the tensile elongation.Flexural strength was less than baseline while flexural modulus
          was above baseline,however,
          the data was within acceptable variation considering the age of the polymer.

          After both 11 and 15years of service in a natural gas compressor, the integrity of the Duratron T4540
          PAI seals appears to be very similar to current production.
