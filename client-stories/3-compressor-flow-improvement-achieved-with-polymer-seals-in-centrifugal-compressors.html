          We are glad to share a client case documented by J. Whalen (2013) where more than 3% improvement of compressor flow was
          achieved following the replacement of metal seals with our Duratron PAI polymer seals. The user case discusses the
          upgrade
          of seven compressors at a 1.5 billion pounds/year (680,000 Tonnes/year) ethylene plant in Orange, Texas. It follows the
          upgrade process and includes the upgrade of a single compressor as a benchmark for performance improvement expectations.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mcam-section-article__content-title mcam-headline-3">Context</h2>
        <p class="mcam-body-text">
          At this facility, there is a 10,000 hp (7.5 MW) booster compressor ahead of the traditional charge gas train. The charge
          gas train is shown in the photograph in figure 1 and schematically in figure 2. This booster compressor can be removed
          from service without forcing the rest of the unit down. It was decided to upgrade this compressor to evaluate
          thermoplastic seals. The seals were installed in September of 1997.

        <h2 class="mcam-section-article__content-title mcam-headline-3">Evaluation</h2>
        <p class="mcam-body-text">
          When the compressor was brought down to install the polymer seals, the only work performed that would affect efficiency
          was the installation of the upgraded seals. This allowed the efficiency change to be attributed solely to the
          thermoplastic seals. After the upgrade, the plant personnel determined the <strong>compressor flow increased 3.1% and the steam
          turbine driver steam consumption was reduced 2.7%.</strong> Based upon this, the plant easily decided to upgrade the other six candidate compressors that would be opened during the major turnaround in March
          of 1999. The compressors upgraded include: the first two cases of the charge gas train (first three compression stages,
          figure 3), the two propylene compressors, the ethylene compressor, and the purge propylene compressor.

          Three compressors not upgraded at that time where the last stage of the charge gas, which had abradable seals running against rotating teeth, and the two methane compressors that were being considered for replacement or major rerates. Based upon the success of all of the other compressors upgraded and considering some issues experienced by DuPont in the past with the abradable seals in the 4th stage charge gas compressor; the plant decided to go ahead and remove the teeth off the last charge gas compressor and upgrade with thermoplastic seals. These seals were installed in July of 2005 and spares supplied in January of 2006.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mcam-section-article__content-title mcam-headline-3">Results</h2>
        <p class="mcam-body-text">
          Often it is difficult to accurately determine the true impact of a seal upgrade project. However, by carefully analysing all factors DuPont was able to estimate the following (attributed to the thermoplastic seal upgrade project): 
          <ul>
            <li>7% reduction in steam flow to the ethylene driver.</li>
            <li>17% increase in head coupled with a 5% gas flow increase accompanied by a 5% increase in motor power consumption with the purge propylene train. Overall an efficiency gain even though the motor draw did increase. </li>
            <li>9 to 16% increase in flow with the propylene compressor coupled with an 8% speed increase and a 4% steam flow increase. (Note: due to the seal problem mentioned earlier only a fraction of the seals were upgraded.) </li>
            <li>14% flow increase in the charge gas train with a 5% steam flow increase.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="mcam-section-article__content-title mcam-headline-3">Experience to date</h2>
        <p class="mcam-body-text">As outlined above DuPont installed Duratron PAI seals in the charge gas booster compressor in 1997. Based on this success, DuPont
        installed Duratron PAI seals in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd stage charge gas compressors, the high case and low case propylene compressors, the ethylene and the purge propylene compressors during the 1999 turn around (TA).</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="mcam-body-text">Unfortunately, fouling in the booster and some of the charge compressors made it difficult to remove the seals intact for reuse. DuPont replaced these with new seals in each subsequent TA (2003, 2008) and several smaller outages in between. DuPont tried numerous methods of removal (solvent soak, tapping/beating, pressing, etc) with no success. Duratron PAI seals in the clean, refrigeration compressors were in good condition and reused in the 2008 TA. The seals in the propylene compressors survived the ingestion of suction drum demister screens and are still running today (2013).</p>
        <p class="mcam-body-text">Seals installed in a charge gas compressor, after a 5-year run, are shown in the photographs in figures 4 and 5. Note that with cleaner sections of this train the seals did not foul, and obviously they did not foul in the clean propylene and ethylene refrigeration compressors.</p>
